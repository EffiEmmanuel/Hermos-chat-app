# Hermos-chat-app

Hi there!
This is a basic chat application I built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

This is a breakdown:
FRONT-END
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript and AJAX
4. PHP

BACK-END
1. PHP
2. SQL
3. MySQL Database

I uploaded an SQL file in the root directory (hermos-chat.php) and that is the database that would power the back-end of this application. All tables and columns have been structured properly.
