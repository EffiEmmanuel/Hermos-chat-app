# Hermos-chat-app

Hi there!
This is a basic chat application I built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

This is a breakdown:
<h3> FRONT-END</h3>
<ol>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript and AJAX</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ol>

<h3> BACK-END</h3>
<ol>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>MySQL Database</li>
</ol>

I uploaded an SQL file in the root directory (hermos-chat.php) and that is the database that would power the back-end of this application. All tables and columns have been structured properly.
